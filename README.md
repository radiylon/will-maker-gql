## // run locally

*If you'd like to check out the project's frontend, please see [will-maker-web](https://github.com/radiylon/will-maker-web).  It is not necessary to run the application, as you can use [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/) as a playground for running queries and mutations.  For more information, check Apollo's docs [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/).

After cloning the project, run the following commands:

### `npm install`

Install dependencies.

### `npm run start` or `npm run serve`

`npm run start` runs the app normally
`npm run serve` runs the app with nodemon for fast refresh

You should see `MongoDB connected... ` and a corresponding server is running message.

Once the app is running, open [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to view the project in your browser.  Note: Might require an additional click to get into Apollo Studio.
